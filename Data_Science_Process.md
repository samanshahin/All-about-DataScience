Data Science Process comprises of several steps:

### 1. defining the problem, drawing diagrams, providing some theoretical issues, blablabla 

   - we're not going to dive into this but maybe you can find some information in another post

### 2. collecting data

### 3. training data to make a model

better to refer to these links for detailed explanation: 

for model selection and evaluation: https://realdsprojs.blogspot.com/2020/11/model-selection-and-evaluation.html

for for regression and classification: https://realdsprojs.blogspot.com/2020/11/regression-and-classification.html

for preprocessing and dimension reduction: https://realdsprojs.blogspot.com/2020/11/preprocessing-and-dimensionality.html

for clustering: https://realdsprojs.blogspot.com/2020/11/clustering.html

### 4. test your model by more data and prepare it for prediction

But as a data scientist who is going to work with Python and its libraries you should consider other view angles and go through some steps. In this post we're going to talk about technical information of these steps with examples and detailed explanations.
